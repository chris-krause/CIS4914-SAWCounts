# UF Senior Project - counting walks, loops, and paths

I design and implement efficient recursive algorithms that enumerate the following mathematical objects on square lattice grids:

* Self-avoiding walks
  * A sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once
  * [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk)

* Self-avoiding polygons
  * A closed self-avoiding walk on a lattice
 
* Hamiltonian paths
  * A path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once
  * [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)
