# UF Senior Project - counting walks, loops, and paths

I design and implement efficient recursive algorithms that enumerate the following mathematical objects on lattice grids with a maximum height of 4:

* Self-avoiding walks
  * A sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once
  * [Online article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-avoiding_walk)

* Self-avoiding polygons
  * A closed self-avoiding walk on a lattice
  * [Online article](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Self-AvoidingPolygon.html#:~:text=A%20lattice%20polygon%20consisting%20of,defined%20for%20self%2Davoiding%20polygons.)
 
* Hamiltonian paths
  * A path in a graph that visits every vertex exactly once
  * [Online article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)

* Hamiltonian cycles
  * A closed loop in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once
  * [Online article][(https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HamiltonianCycle.html#:~:text=A%20Hamiltonian%20cycle%2C%20also%20called,to%20be%20a%20Hamiltonian%20graph.)]
